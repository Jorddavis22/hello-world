Hello Everyone!

Jordan here. I am taking my first stab at learning how to write code and am attempting to utilize Python. The intent of this undertaking is two-fold: 1. To understand this crazy little world that runs the larger world we live in. And 2. To ultimately use Python to create screeners that will allow me to improve my personal investment success in equities, bonds, and options.
